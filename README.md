## Features

- **Automated Data Processing:** `execute.py` script for transforming `data.xlsx` into a structured `result.json`.
- **Code Quality:** Integrated `ruff` for linting Python code to maintain high standards.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions automates testing, processing, and publishing on every push.
- **GitHub Pages Publication:** `result.json` is automatically deployed and accessible via GitHub Pages.
- **Responsive Web Interface:** `index.html` provides an overview of the project using Tailwind CSS.

## Setup and Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
    (Replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub details.)

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/macOS
    .venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas openpyxl ruff
    ```
    (Note: `openpyxl` is required for reading `.xlsx` files, `ruff` for linting).

### Running `execute.py` Locally

To process the data and generate `result.json` locally:

```bash
python execute.py > result.json
```

This command will execute the script, which reads `data.xlsx`, performs its operations, and outputs the final JSON to `result.json`.

## Data Files

### `data.xlsx`

This is the primary input data file for the project, provided in Excel format. It contains the raw data that `execute.py` processes.

### `data.csv`

A CSV version of `data.xlsx`. This file is generated from `data.xlsx` (or manually converted) and committed to the repository for convenience and to ensure a stable processing input. Your `execute.py` should be configured to read `data.xlsx` directly, and `data.csv` serves as a committed snapshot.

### `result.json`

This file contains the processed output from `execute.py`. It is generated by the CI pipeline and is **not committed** to the repository directly. Instead, it is published via GitHub Pages. You can view the latest `result.json` [here](https://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>/result.json).
(Remember to replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_REPO_NAME>` with your actual details.)

## GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow

The project utilizes GitHub Actions to automate several tasks upon every push to the repository.

### Workflow File

The CI/CD pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write # Needed for actions/upload-pages-artifact
      pages: write    # Needed for actions/deploy-pages
      id-token: write # Needed for actions/deploy-pages

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Python 3.11
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
        cache: 'pip'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install pandas openpyxl ruff

    - name: Run Ruff Linter
      run: ruff check .

    - name: Run execute.py and generate result.json
      run: python execute.py > result.json

    - name: Setup Pages
      uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

    - name: Upload result.json artifact
      uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
      with:
        path: 'result.json' # Path to the file to be published

    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      id: deployment
      uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### Workflow Steps

1.  **Checkout Code:** Retrieves the repository content.
2.  **Setup Python:** Configures a Python 3.11 environment.
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Installs `pandas`, `openpyxl`, and `ruff`.
4.  **Run Ruff Linter:** Checks Python code for style and errors using `ruff check .`.
5.  **Run `execute.py`:** Executes the main data processing script using `python execute.py > result.json`.
6.  **Upload `result.json` to GitHub Pages:** Uses `actions/upload-pages-artifact` to prepare `result.json` for deployment.
7.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages:** Uses `actions/deploy-pages` to publish the generated `result.json` to your GitHub Pages site.

### Publishing `result.json`

The generated `result.json` is published automatically via GitHub Pages. After a successful CI run on the `main` branch, you can access the latest `result.json` at:

`https://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>/result.json`

Please ensure GitHub Pages is configured in your repository settings to build and deploy from the `gh-pages` branch or a `docs` folder as per your `actions/deploy-pages` setup.
